#### An IoT device for Embedded Systems ELEC60013

---

*Developed by: Alexander Limonov, Matteus Tannase, Miles Grist, Nikolay Miladinov* 

Figure skaters are exposed to large forces when spinning and landing jumps.
This device aims to provide methods for fast quantitative and qualitative feedback to athletes when training specific
skating skills, aiding in progression and monitoring physical health.

---

### Implemented Features (*within scope of project*):
1. Jump: peak relative landing force
2. Jump: weight distribution (forwards/backwards)
3. Jump&Spin: Peak and average angular velocity

---

### Future Scope:
1. Analysis of pushing technique
2. Advice on joint health
3. Total session statistics for both feet
   1. Time spent on each foot
   2. Estimated relative training of each leg
